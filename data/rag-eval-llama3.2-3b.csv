"Based on the provided CONTEXT, I'm assuming you're asking how long vegetables and beans should be prepared before blending with a blender.

Unfortunately, there isn't a specific answer to this question from the provided recipes. However, we can look at some of the recipes that involve chopping or preparing vegetables and beans before cooking.

In Recipe: Tofu Curry ( Vegetarian), it says ""1. Chop vegetables and prepare egg."" It doesn't specify how long the preparation time is, but it implies that some preparation time is needed before cooking with the blender.

Similarly, in Recipe: Chicken Stir-Fry (Paleo), it says ""1. Wash and prep all ingredients."" This also suggests that some preparation time is needed before starting to cook with the blender.

However, I did find a recipe where the prep time is mentioned, but it's not related to blending vegetables and beans. In Recipe: Keto Chicken Salad (Paleo), it says ""prep_time_minutes: 56"".

"Based on the provided CONTEXT and the nutritional information, I can suggest some protein substitutions for tofu in the Tofu Curry recipe.

Given that the meal type is Lunch and the dietary category is Paleo, a suitable substitute for tofu would be beans. Since beans are not listed among the ingredients, let's consider other options like chicken or salmon. However, these alternatives would change the flavor profile and nutritional content of the dish.

Considering the keto diet requirement, it's essential to choose a protein source that fits within the daily limit of fat intake (typically 70-80% of daily calories). 

Among the available ingredients in the Tofu Curry recipe (garlic, mushroom, spinach), tofu can be substituted with another non-dairy ingredient. Mushrooms have a meaty texture and can absorb flavors well, making them an excellent substitute for tofu.

Please note that substituting tofu may alter the taste, texture, or nutritional content of the dish.",76,Can I substitute tofu with another protein in this dish?,NON_RELEVANT,Failed to parse evaluator response
